# Conclusions

## Marvel

Marvel is a highly accurate rank-3 temperament. With optimal tuning, it has a mean error of ~2c and max error of ~4c for 7-limit consonances. Marvel can be notated using two pairs of accidentals.

72edo is a near-optimal Marvel tuning.

## Meantone

With optimal tuning, septimal Meantone has a mean error of ~6c and max error of ~12c for 7-limit consonances. As a rank-2 temperament, only one pair of accidentals is required, and intervals can be named using conventional major/minor/augmented/diminished terminology.

31edo is a near-optimal Meantone tuning. 19edo is a slight improvement over 12edo for 5-limit consonances, and a more substantial improvment for 7-limit consonances.

## Porcupine

Meantone is more accurate than Porcupine in both the 5-limit and 7-limit. 5-limit accuracy is comparable to that of 12edo, although 7-limit error is about halved.

22edo is a near-optimal Porcupine tuning.

## Pajara

Pajara is comparable to meantone in 5-limit accuracy, but suffers in the 7-limit.

22edo isn't as good a Pajara tuning as I expected it to be; it adds a nontrivial amount of error in the 5-limit.

## Magic

Magic is almost as accurate as Marvel, but conceptually less familiar and arguably more annoying to notate.
